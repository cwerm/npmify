# Contributing to NPMify
Keep in mind that this is a living document, and in the _very_ early stages. The goal is to keep the process as easy and open as possible.

- To contribute code, fork this repo and make your changes. When you're done implementing your feature/bug fix, simply open a PR.
- To open an issue, just open an issue. Easy peasy.
